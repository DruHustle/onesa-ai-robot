# Software simulation architecture

## Full-body humanoid reference — source development

The protected console also exposes `onesa-humanoid-33-v1`: a connected pelvis-rooted
kinematic tree with 3 torso axes, 2 head axes, 8 axes in each arm (including one
coupled grip axis), and 6 axes in each leg. Its 34 links and 33 revolute joints are
available as authenticated URDF. The SVG joint tree uses the same origins, axes and
current simulated positions. This is reference geometry: no masses, inertias,
collision shapes, contact model, balancing controller or walking capability is claimed.

`robot_api/humanoid.py` defines a whole-frame actuator interface and its in-memory
simulated implementation. A complete frame must satisfy every reference position
limit before any joint changes. Coordinated quintic trajectories share a duration
and are checked against peak velocity and acceleration before proposal. Limits and
effort values are synthetic; a bank reporting physical actuation is rejected. No
serial, CAN, DDS, ROS driver, device discovery or physical transport is opened.

The authenticated `/api/v1/humanoid` routes provide `model`, `model.urdf`, `state`,
`proposals`, `proposals/{command_id}/approve` and a command-bound `heartbeat`.
Mutations retain the existing session, exact Origin and CSRF checks. Approval binds
the proposing session, command UUID, model, start frame, revision, full target frame
and SHA-256 review digest, requires the operator password, and rechecks session,
freshness and Stop epoch after confirmation. The proposal expires after 15 seconds.
Inspection, legacy joint and humanoid work exclude each other's pending/running
motion; an operator must finish or Stop the current work before switching modes.

Only a successfully observed running command can receive the panel's dedicated
heartbeat. Legacy console polls do not renew it. The server refuses another
session's heartbeat or a late heartbeat after expiry. Heartbeat loss, logout,
session expiry, Stop, watchdog failure, storage failure and shutdown revoke the
whole-body command. Stop remains independent of queued journal mutations and
password verification; adapter Stop failure still revokes authority and latches a
simulator fault. Reset never resumes previous work or clears an actuator fault.

The panel presents a separate, read-only table of the exact proposed start and
target values; draft inputs and neutral/duration controls lock during review and
execution. Stop requests use an independent client, including during an unresolved
proposal or approval acknowledgement. Closing, hiding or leaving the panel requests
Stop and pauses its heartbeat. An unacknowledged Stop is reported as uncertain;
users must verify the stopped state before resetting. Session loss clears protected
controls, proposals, passwords and the rendered model. System appearance changes
preserve the current draft and focus.

Humanoid frames and the most recent 64 terminal plans live only in process memory;
they do not enter the inspection task journal and do not survive restart. Compact
UUID replay protection is retained for up to 10,000 accepted proposals per process;
at capacity new proposals are refused rather than forgotten. Restart restores no
humanoid proposal or execution authority. This source capability requires ordinary
CI and hosted acceptance before a release; it does not change accepted production
identities or commission physical hardware.

## Administrator permission and future physical controllers

The owner identifies the product as pre-launch and under development; hardware
has not yet been developed. The new administration software separates
**permission**, **controller connection/readiness**, and **actual operation**.
An explicit `ROBOT_ADMINISTRATOR_NAME` may identify only the existing configured
operator. Other operator sessions receive 403 from all administration endpoints.
`/api/v1/admin/physical-operation` is authenticated, non-cacheable state; its
`allow` operation requires the administrator password, current revision and an
already-stopped idle simulator. `block` needs the administrator session and CSRF
but no extra password, and invalidates any in-flight allow confirmation.

Permission is bound to the issuing session, expires with it, and is revoked on
logout, process restart, Stop, storage failure or watchdog failure. It is held
in process memory, with no new remote table, migration, operator account or
credential. It cannot approve/replay simulator tasks or send hardware commands.
The software truthfully reports `not_connected`, `not_ready` and `inactive`
until a real controller is integrated; an administrative allow is never reported
as physical actuation. Future hardware adapters must enforce device identity,
fresh bounded control authority, local interlocks, emergency stop and watchdog
independently. The existing telemetry-only edge bearer grants none of that authority.

```

No model output or ROS message grants authority. Quintic smooth-step trajectories
are checked against synthetic SI-unit position/velocity/acceleration limits.
Proposals expire after 15 seconds; UUID reuse is rejected. Only one task runs, owned
by its approving session. Heartbeat loss, expiry, logout, cancel/stop, watchdog failure
or restart removes in-memory execution authority. Operator reset never resumes work.

Storage tables: sessions (hashed opaque token, CSRF, expiry, operator), tasks (ID,
operator, validated proposal, state/reason, timestamps and synthetic position), safety
(single durable stop latch). Sessions are revoked on process startup. No product
customer data or sibling database is used. Query results and UI text are bounded.

Auth/CSRF/ownership, limits, stale/future messages, completion, replay, connection
loss, cancellation, session expiry/revocation and restart are software tests. There
is no actual perception/model-policy path, connected ROS runtime or hardware safety
certification. Those dependencies must remain explicit, never silently simulated
inside a response labelled as a real robot or real model.

## Remote-journal lease confirmation

The cloud journal has one database-fenced writer. Ordinary statements remain
bounded to two seconds. The prepared read-only renewal confirmation has a
five-second bound and a seven-second complete renewal bound, below the existing
fifteen-second readiness window after the five-second renewal interval. Only the
exact same-owner lease SELECT receives this longer bound. Its database lifetime
must retain the existing eighteen-second minimum and cover measured response
age, fifteen-second readiness and a one-second resolution margin. An uncertain
write is never replayed. Failure still stops and requires controlled recovery;
this preparation is not evidence that it is deployed or that hardware is ready.

Invalid remote-journal JSON, including nesting beyond the decoder's capacity,
becomes a redacted protocol failure under the same stop/recovery path. Byte limits
and deadlines remain enforced, and parsing failures never replay a statement.

## Prepared idle-only transport recovery

This correction is source-tested and remains unreleased until the normal exact-source
CI, staging and production acceptance gates pass. It does not establish high
availability or identify the original provider/network timeout cause.

A transient renewal timeout/transport error may enter bounded recovery only when
this instance had already initialized, was stopped and idle, had no pending tasks
or dirty writes, and had no physical actuation enabled. Other failure categories,
active/armed/uncertain work, schema/history changes and exhausted attempts remain
latched for controlled operator recovery.

After delays of 30, 60 and 120 seconds, at most three attempts may acquire a fresh
random lease identity through the existing atomic expired-owner condition. A live
other owner is never displaced. Remote terminal history must exactly match the
last acknowledged history and local cache; no task record is repaired, replayed,
removed or resumed. A new successful renewal must precede readiness. Ordinary
statement, confirmation and readiness bounds remain unchanged.

Recovery revokes previous sessions and administrative motion permission, preserves
the stopped state and requires fresh operator sign-in/reset. The simulator resumes
no task. Each recovery attempt is bounded to 20 seconds; independent Stop/heartbeat/
logout handling and the safety watchdog stay available. There is no process restart,
new account, credential change, migration or hardware activation.

## Optional simulated edge telemetry

The separate `edge/simulation-agent.py` sends version-1 HTTPS telemetry outbound to
the current Oracle-hosted API through its existing HTTPS ingress. It uses an independent per-device bearer token; the API stores only SHA256
of that token. Boot challenge, monotonic sequence, three-second freshness and ten
requests/second are enforced. Telemetry is explicitly synthetic and stopped, and
cannot create/approve/reset tasks or change the safety gate. Stale/disconnected
telemetry becomes `not_connected`. Bounded telemetry audit is in process memory;
it is not durable compliance logging. Task history remains in private SQLite.

Boot challenges accept only the server-issued 43-character URL-safe ASCII format.
Malformed challenges fail schema validation before identity comparison and do not
advance device sequence, connection freshness or audit state.

No inbound edge listener, DDS exposure, Robot control tunnel, router change or automatic retry
is introduced. A failed agent stops and requires operator restart. There is no
cloud-to-edge motion/action transport: the cloud simulator retains its existing
independent motion gate, while a future real edge adapter must enforce its own
hardware-specific safety rules regardless of cloud state. Follow the separate
[release process](AUTOMATED_QUALIFICATION.md) before packaging/installing any adapter.

## Public product, operator context and system appearance

The public product root renders a static concept image without JavaScript or
private API subscriptions. `/console` has a task-oriented operator shell; backend
session/CSRF and ownership decide access. Status observation times and deployment
labels come from protected runtime responses, independently of simulation mode.
Both shells consume the exact shared foundation recorded in
`design-system.consumer.json`. CSS follows browser/OS preference without a clock,
selector or stored theme. A preference transition cannot reconnect telemetry, submit
commands, clear a draft, change focus or revoke a session.

## Separate PC–VM administrative tunnel

```mermaid

 PC[Owner PC / approved identity] -->|Tailscale encrypted administrative tunnel| VM[Approved VM / approved node]
 Console[Tailscale administrative console] -. identity and scoped ACL/grants .-> PC
 Console -. device policy .-> VM
 Operator[Robot operator] -->|HTTPS and session/CSRF| Robot[Cloud simulation API]
 Edge[Synthetic edge agent] -->|HTTPS and independent device identity| Robot
```

The owner-reported PC–VM tunnel is included as an administrative dependency; active
node/ACL/transport state still requires actual read-only account/host evidence. Robot
simulation and its edge telemetry retain their separate authorization and transport.
A tailnet connection grants no operator role or physical readiness. Do not expose
public controller/DDS/model ports, alter unrelated access or put Tailscale node keys
in docs. Current policy decisions remain in the Portal governance database rather
than a competing mutable Markdown policy store.

## Next software milestone: one bounded joint-position task (proposed)

Use the existing single-joint simulator to evaluate one task: reach a requested
position inside its configured SI-unit limits, then remain stopped. This is a
software experiment plan, not demonstrated learned control or hardware operation.

- **Observation:** synthetic joint position, task state and sample age. There is
  no camera, object detection or physical perception claim.
- **Baseline and planning:** compare the existing scripted trajectory with a future
  advice-only policy proposal using identical seeded starting positions and goals.
  The policy cannot approve tasks, alter limits or call physical controllers.
- **Control and safety:** retain password-confirmed approval, the independent
  deterministic motion gate, freshness checks, Stop and session/watchdog revocation.
  Invalid or uncertain proposals stop; they never fall back to unlabelled motion.
- **Evaluation:** report goal error, completion time, limit violations, stale/replay
  rejection and Stop latency over the same retained seeds. Include expired sessions,
  out-of-range goals and delayed observations. Report collision evaluation as not
  applicable because this simulator has no collision geometry.
- **Telemetry:** use isolated synthetic records with explicit simulation labels;
  preserve operator authorization and record source, seed and failure categories.

Before implementing a learned policy, review its model/data rights, supported
interface and bounded evaluation budget separately. Physical controllers, local
interlocks and emergency-stop qualification require their own hardware integration;
passing this milestone grants no physical-operation authority.

## Next physical-controller acceptance plan — proposed, not authorised to execute

Before a hardware experiment, the owner must supply the actual controller, joint,
limits, enclosure/work area, device identities, qualified safety engineer and local
emergency-stop/interlock design. Record manufacturer manuals and firmware/revision
provenance, permitted operators, hazards, test boundaries, stopping criteria and
an explicit hardware-test authorisation. No physical target or measured safety
performance is established by this plan.

| Gate | Required evidence before proceeding |
| --- | --- |
| Bench identification | Controller/drive/motor/sensor serials and firmware; wiring, units, gearing, limits and independently reviewed hazards. |
| Passive connection | Read-only device authentication and telemetry; timestamp/sequence/freshness, disconnect and wrong-device refusal; zero motion output. |
| Independent stop | Hardware emergency stop/interlock/watchdog proven without relying on browser, model or remote API; actual measured stop response under the reviewed procedure. |
| Authority | Fresh designated-operator session, explicit scoped permission, proposal expiry, password confirmation, limits and physical enabling are independently checked. |
| Bounded movement | Only after the preceding gates and separate motion authority: one approved joint/trajectory within the reviewed work area; record actual position/velocity/current and failure observations. |
| Failure and restart | Lost heartbeat/network/sensor, stale/replayed command, operator logout/revocation and process/controller restart stop/refuse; no command replay or automatic resume. |
| Review | Named engineer reviews raw measurements, deviations and residual risk for the exact hardware/firmware/configuration. No safety certification or general deployment approval is inferred. |

Every failed or unobserved gate stops the next stage. Software simulator results,
future speech/perception/VLA plans and session permission do not substitute for
physical qualification. Preserve the current software simulator and its data while
this separate development target remains unavailable.

The runtime security candidate uses official Node 24.22.1 for the separately packaged frontend image, following the [Node maintainer security advisory](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/october-2026-security-releases). This changes no simulator/controller authority, hardware readiness or physical motion scope; provider-managed frontend and Python API image identities remain independently qualified.

## Versioned industrial inspection

The `inspection` module separates immutable mission requests/plans, profile and
skill declarations, deterministic observations, evaluation and read-only reporting.
`POST /api/v1/missions` builds the P-101 plan on the server. Plans bind the scenario
and seed, reference asset/limits, complete profile, skill digest, starting pose,
bounded target/durations and five versioned steps. A SHA256 covers the whole plan.
Approval requires the existing session, Origin/CSRF and password plus that exact
hash within15seconds. The legacy task approval path cannot approve a mission.
Changed capabilities, skills, source context or starting pose fail independent
validation. One mission uses the existing single-active-task authority; no model,
imported text, render frame or replay command becomes another executor.

A run contains at most16 transitions, three observations, three telemetry values
and nine findings. The optional proposal extension fits within the existing16KiB
fenced journal payload; no migration or second journal is introduced. Simulator
motion is calculated by the independent quintic gate. Journal writes occur at
step/terminal transitions, not per rendered frame. Normal execution, completed
findings, interruption and failure are distinct outcomes. Stop/watchdog/session
loss/storage failure/restart cancel authority and preserve partial evidence. Reset
never resumes a mission. Restart duration is the last recorded evidence duration;
no unobserved interval or exact crash time is reconstructed.

The native SVG scene illustrates the industrial task and observed/calculated joint
position. It is not rigid-body physics, camera/OCR, learned inference or hardware.
Terminal replay interpolates the same recorded bounded trajectory and displays
recorded events; slider/play/pause operate entirely in the browser and issue no
API request. Structured exports are authenticated and object-owned. Public pages
are script-free, contain only original illustration/copy, and never read records.
The console polls at500ms for active/pending tasks and3s when idle, suspends reads
and replay when hidden, and pauses replay off-screen or for reduced motion.

Optional `ROBOT_CONTEXT_IMPORT_ENABLED` defaults false. An owned AI Platform
`/api/v1/twins/assets/{id}/robotics/v1` download supplies a read-only file, never an
AI-to-Robot login or service token. Robot accepts at most240KB of source JSON,
16levels, strict contract/version and explicit three-tag mapping in expected P-101
units. The AI contract’s UCUM `Cel` is an exact symbol alias for °C; the
original `source_unit` remains in evidence. No Kelvin/Pascal conversion is guessed.
Only this import HTTP path has a256KiB envelope; operational bodies remain
16KiB. Preserve source asset UUID, source/tag reference, original timestamp/unit,
declared connection/quality and server-computed raw-file digest. Imported content
is untrusted, not signed operational authority or a verified live feed. A session
can review at most four snapshots, expiring after10minutes (global16); logout and
restart discard transient imports. A new plan copies its reviewed bounded snapshot
into the journal. The existing live export excludes simulated data; missing,
revoked, stale or unmapped evidence cannot silently become a fresh observation.
No external URL is fetched and no maintenance write is implemented.

See [FluxVLA evaluation](FLUXVLA_EVALUATION.md) for the pinned third-party review
and precise deferred model-evaluation path. No new service, GPU or paid resource
is required by the deterministic workflow.

Inspection history renders six recent records directly and groups older entries in
an expandable list. It keeps the current DOM when the owned mission list has not
changed, preserving focus and disclosure state during background refreshes. Reports,
exports and replay still read the same bounded journal records; collapsing older
entries deletes no history and issues no operational request.
