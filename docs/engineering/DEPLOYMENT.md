Public repository history may contain earlier editions; moving this active copy
does not erase historical exposure. Credentials, records and release evidence
belong in their existing restricted stores, never in this reference page.

## Oracle owner-run evidence bridge

The new `scripts/release/oracle_owner.py` adapter preserves owner-run receipts
with workflow run ID `0` and genuine CI run references. It requires a separately
commissioned, pinned external verifier and owner-controlled signing custody.
Repository code or an unsigned JSON file supplies no release authority.
The protected guide contains installation, qualification and recovery instructions;
source implementation alone does not establish commissioning or deployment.
